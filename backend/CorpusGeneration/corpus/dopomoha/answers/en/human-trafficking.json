      "question": "What steps can people take to protect themselves from becoming victims?",
      "answer": "To limit vulnerability to trafficking, individuals should know their rights and where to access services and support. It is important to maintain possession of documents, stay in touch with trusted people, and gather enough information about travel plans, routes, addresses, and employers, sharing this with others. Developing a secret 'safeword' with trusted persons is also advised.",
