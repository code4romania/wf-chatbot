      "question": "What are the benefits of breastfeeding, especially during emergencies?",
      "answer": "Breastfeeding strengthens a child's immunity and provides essential nutrients, even if the mother's diet is unbalanced. In emergencies, it is the most convenient and safest way to feed a child, and direct physical contact helps the child feel secure. Hormones produced also enhance the mother's sense of peace and security, and breast milk can be life-saving if no other food is available.",

      "question": "How can I ensure my child gets proper nutrition in difficult situations?",
      "answer": "Prioritize breastfeeding as it provides all necessary substances for babies under two. If breastfeeding is not possible, babies under 6 months can be fed ready-to-use commercial infant formula, while children older than 6 months can have animal milk and complementary foods.

      "question": "How can I support breastfeeding if it is challenging or if I have to express milk?",
      "answer": "To maintain lactation if separated from your baby, drain milk as often as the child would eat, at least 8 times a day, using clean hands and a closed container. Feed expressed milk from a spoon or cup. If facing difficulties, try to restore milk flow by frequently putting the baby to the breast, drinking more water, massaging the neck, resting, taking a warm shower, and eating well.",
