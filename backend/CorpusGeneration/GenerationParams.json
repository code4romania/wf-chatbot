IMPORTANT: Focus on the MAIN TOPICS of the page — do not ask overly specific questions. Only generate questions that begin with 'What', 'How', or 'When'. Do NOT start questions with words like 'Is', 'Are', 'Was', etc. Each question must make complete sense on its own and be fully understandable without context. Avoid using vague terms like 'this', 'these', 'summary', or 'content' in the question. BAD Examples:   - 'Is it important?' (yes/no and unclear)   - 'Can you apply?' (lacks context)   - 'What is its purpose?' (too vague) SUPER IMPORTANT: Return only a valid Python list literal of the questions.",
