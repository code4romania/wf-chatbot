      "question": "How do cookies work?",
      "answer": "Cookies are small files, a succession of letters and numbers, stored on any internet-accessing terminal upon a request from a server to a browser. They consist of a name and content, with a limited existence, and can be accessed again by the webserver when a user returns to the associated website. This allows a website to recognize a browser and react accordingly, storing information until the cookie expires or is deleted.",

      "question": "What are the potential risks of cookies?",
      "answer": "While not viruses, cookies can be used as a form of spyware because they store information about users' preferences and browsing history across multiple sites. Information contained in cookies can be intercepted if an attacker intervenes during data transmission over an unencrypted network. Additionally, attackers can exploit misset cookies on servers to trick browsers into sending information over unsecured channels, gaining unauthorized access to certain websites.",
