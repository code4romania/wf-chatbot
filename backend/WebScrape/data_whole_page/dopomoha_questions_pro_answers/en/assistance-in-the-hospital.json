      "question": "What are the differences between public and private hospitals regarding insurance coverage?",
      "answer": "Public hospitals with insurance contracts provide free medical services to insured patients and cannot collect additional payments.

Private hospitals under contract with health insurance companies can charge a personal contribution, which is the difference between the rate settled by the health insurance company and the rate charged by the private hospital.",

      "question": "How are costs handled for hospital stays?",
