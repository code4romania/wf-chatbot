      "answer": "Beneficiaries of temporary protection receive a document to remain, information on protection, rights to employment/independent activities, assistance for maintenance, medical assistance for special needs, and access to state education for minors.

      "question": "How can someone find work in the country?",
      "answer": "Beneficiaries of temporary protection can be hired with a residence permit without a work notice or visa, and can provide a statement if documents are missing (except for liberal professions).

Asylum seekers can work after acquiring refugee status or three months after applying, if no decision has been made. All can register with county employment agencies for incentive measures and unemployment insurance.",
