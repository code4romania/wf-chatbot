      "answer": "Basic hygiene practices include frequent hand washing with soap, especially after visiting the toilet, being on public transport, or before cooking and eating.

      "question": "How can limited resources affect hygiene routines?",
      "answer": "Limited resources can affect hygiene routines by reducing access to water, heat, food, and hygiene supplies. This may necessitate using less water for daily needs, relying on hand sanitizers or wet wipes when soap and water are unavailable, and finding alternative solutions like making homemade diapers or reusing disposable ones.",

      "question": "What are some ways to maintain hygiene when regular supplies are unavailable?",
      "answer": "If soap and water are unavailable, use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, rubbing it into hands for 20-30 seconds, or use alcohol or antibacterial wet wipes.
