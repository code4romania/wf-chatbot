      "question": "What are the differences between public and private hospitals regarding insurance coverage?",
      "answer": "In public hospitals with health insurance contracts, insured patients receive free medical services, and the hospital cannot collect additional payments. In contrast, private hospitals with contracts can charge a personal contribution, which is the difference between the health insurance company's settled rate and the hospital's charged rate. If a hospital, public or private, does not have a contract, the patient bears the full cost without reimbursement from the health insurance company.",

      "question": "How are costs handled for hospital stays?",
      "answer": "For insured patients in public hospitals with health insurance contracts, all expenses for their stay are covered, and the hospital cannot collect further payments. If a patient pays for services that should have been free in a public hospital, they can request reimbursement. In private hospitals with contracts, patients may pay a personal contribution, which is the difference between the insurer's settled rate and the hospital's rate. If a hospital lacks a contract, the patient bears all costs.",
