      "question": "What are the benefits of breastfeeding, especially during emergencies?",
      "answer": "Breastfeeding strengthens a child's immunity and provides essential physical contact, helping them feel safe during emergencies. It is the most convenient and safest way to feed a child, and mothers can continue to breastfeed effectively even with an unbalanced diet. In the absence of other food, breast milk can exclusively sustain a child under two years old to save their life.",

      "question": "How can I ensure my child gets proper nutrition in difficult situations?",
      "answer": "Ensuring proper nutrition involves continuing breastfeeding for babies, as it provides all necessary substances. If breastfeeding is not possible, babies under 6 months can be fed ready-to-use liquid formula, while children older than 6 months can have animal milk and complementary foods. For small children, stock up on instant cereals, mashed meats, fish, and vegetables, and always ensure access to clean drinking water.",

      "question": "How can I support breastfeeding if it is challenging or if I have to express milk?",
      "answer": "If your baby is not with you, continue to drain milk with your hands or a pump at least 8 times a day into a clean, closed container, feeding it from a spoon or cup. To restore lactation, frequently put the baby to the breast, drink more water, massage your neck, get enough rest, take a warm shower, and try to eat well. For persistent difficulties, seek guidance from the Support for refugee women program.",
