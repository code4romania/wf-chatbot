      "question": "How can Ukrainian refugees access healthcare in Romania?",
      "answer": "Ukrainian refugees access healthcare by being registered by providers in an IT application from the National Health Insurance House when they request medical services for the first time. This process assigns them an identification number, and a printed document with this number is provided for use at any medical unit in Romania. The family doctor serves as the first point of contact and provides services from the basic package without requiring registration on their specific list.",
